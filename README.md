A basic deep learning project

Technology used-Python

Model used-Convolutional Neural Network(Deep Learning Model)

Librares used- Tensorflow, keras, os, sys, io, image_from_download

This project is a simple image classification of pictures.
Avoiding the tedious task of cpoy and pasting and renaming, i have created two python scripts which would help to download the images of the person or character i require and rename them in a particular sequence.

In the Dataset folder three folders are present-
TRAIN folder which has 40 photos of Thanos and Jokar for training the model
,TEST folder which has 10 random images for testing the model
,VAL foldet which has 10 images each of Tanos and Jokar to validate the model

Rest of the coding is self explanotory. 

Just a brief about the method used-

I used a simple multi layer neural network using the deeep learning libraries and created a neural network which train the model and save the model in a json file and the test.py would load the model and check the accuracy of the model.
